 ## Hi there and welcome !

👋 I'm Rodolphe, welcome to my Github page. You will find few projects mainly related to data science topics.

💎 I'm found of scaling machine learning projects and building frameworks reusable through multiple topics implying structured and unstructured data. On top of that I am really interested in the use of ML projects up to a user experience using complementary knowledge (devops, database administration, front-end developement, librairies, Design thinking, ...).

🔐 I do not share all of my personal projects but will always be happy discussing breakthrough and boundaries of data science related topics.


### Who ? What ?
🔍 I've been a data scientists for 3 years in the banking industry working on financial, risks and marketing use cases (House Pricing, client complaint detector, energy transition helper and many more ...) using Python language mainly (SQL as well when needed), machine and deep learning frameworks leveraging for some with data sciences platform tools.

🤩 I also worked quite a lot on the assessment of the data science platform tools and am really interested in the market of data vizualization, data science, data ops as well as the products.


### My play ground
✈️ Solving problems with optimized ML techniques

🥅 Unstructured and structured data (financial data, scrapped based, ...)

🤖 Competitions (internal / external)

🆕 New tech and ideas
